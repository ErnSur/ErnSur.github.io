I often feel like I have to defend myself when it comes up that I prefer to use macOS over other OS'es. That's why I compiled a list of features/reasons why I prefoer one over the other, enjoy.


## Windows

### Hate
- loves to waste space
- File Explorer
    - no tabs
    - so big
    - two column layout


## macOS
### better fundamentals
- Unix
- better multitasking, multiple monitor support
    - scaling
    - second displays
    - Tab functionality as a OS feature
    - hot corners (desktop and mission control)
- Spotlight
- Quick Look
- finder
    - small
    - a quick options to show/hide hidden files
    - a quick option to copy filepath
    - tabs
    - one column layout (foldouts) 
    - easy dragging on trackpad
### on the fence
- dock

### Hate
- no middle mouse button for trackpad out of the box

### small but great
- super easy to create and use custom icons for file/folders 
- taking screenshots?
### macOS configuration I use
- Better trackpad drag (accessablility feature)
- finder tweeks
